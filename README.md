# QHacks 2024
Official repo for the QHacks 2024 website

## Developing
To work on the QHacks website, these are the steps you must follow:
 - Navigate to the next project
 - `npm i` to get all the packages we use
 - `npm run dev` to start a local version of the website
And you're done! You should now have a working local version of the website.

## Building
This will most likely be handled by Vercel / Netlify, but if you want to build from source for testing purposes, just run `npm run build` to generate a production version of the website.
